# Trade Flow Analysis Global
<h2>This is a project as part of the Social Network Analysis course of the degree in computer science for management at the university of bologna</h2>
<br>In the context of global economic evolution, trade data analysis plays a crucial role in
understanding trade dynamics among nations. Globalization has expanded opportunities for
interchange, bringing with it increasing complexity in international trade patterns. Against
this backdrop, this study aims to explore and analyze the BACI dataset provided by the
French research center CEPII (Centre d'Etudes Prospectives d'Informations Internationales)
on global trade.

<br><h3>Objectives:</h3>
1. To understand how the density of trade between countries changes over
time and the consequences of these changes.
2. Identify the most influential countries in the trade network through
measures of centrality
3. Transform theoretical network analysis into practical and applicable results
for decision makers and stakeholders

<h3>Project Contributions:</h3>
- <b>Theoretical Significance:</b> The project will contribute to the development of
international trade network theory by integrating temporal analysis and node influence
assessment.
<br>- <b>Practical Relevance:</b> It will provide practical tools to analyze the trade network and
identify opportunities or risks related to global trade dynamics.
<br>- <b>Socio-Economic Impact:</b> Information from the project can be used to improve
understanding of global trade relations, guiding more informed and sustainable
economic decisions.
